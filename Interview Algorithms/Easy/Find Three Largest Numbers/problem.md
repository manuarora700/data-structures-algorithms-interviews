## Find Three Largest Numbers

#### Problem Statement

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted array of the three largest integers in the input array. Note that the function should return
duplicate integers if necessary; for example, it should return [10, 10, 12] for an input array of [10, 5, 9, 10, 12].
Sample input: [141, 1, 17, -7, -17, -27, 18, 541, 8, 7, 7]
Sample output: [18, 141, 541]
