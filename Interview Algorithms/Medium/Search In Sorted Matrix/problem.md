## Search In Sorted Matrix

#### Problem Statement

You are given a two-dimensional array (matrix) of distinct integers where each row is sorted and each column is also sorted. The matrix does not necessarily have
the same height and width. You are also given a target number, and you must write a function that returns an array of the row and column indices of the target
number if it is contained in the matrix and [-1, -1] if it is not contained in the matrix.

Sample input:
[
[1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 1000],
[2, 5, 19, 31, 32, 1001],
[3, 8, 24, 33, 35, 1002],
[40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 1003],
[99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004],
], 44

Sample output: [3, 3]
