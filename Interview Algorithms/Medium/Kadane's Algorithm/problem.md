## Kadane's Algorithm

#### Problem Statement

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns the maximum sum that can be obtained by summing up all the numbers in a non-empty
subarray of the input array. A subarray must only contain adjacent numbers.
Sample input: [3, 5, -9, 1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1, -5, 4]
Sample output: 19 ([1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1])
