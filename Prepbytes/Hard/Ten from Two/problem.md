 ​You made up to this question, Congrats for tha
!
￼ Let us solve a fun maths question now. Just do the simple calculation behind it and you are done. You are given a number
n
￼ and you are asked to make
n
￼ divisible by
10
￼. The only operation you can do on
n
￼ is to multiply
n
￼ by
2
￼.
Given
n
￼ find out how many operations are required to make
n
￼ divisible by
10
￼

Input format
First-line contains an integer 
T
, denoting number of test cases. 
Then follows 
T
 test cases. Each test case consists of a single variable 
n
.

Output format
Print 
T
 values. Each line will print number of operations
(
0
 or more
)
 if it is possible to make 
n
 divisible by 
10
 else print 
−
1
.

Sample Test case Explanation
In the first test case, 
n
=
10
 is already divisible by 
10
 so the number of operations performed 
=
0
.
In the second test case, 
n
=
25
 will be divisible by 
10
 after multiplying 
n
 by 
2
 once. 
25
∗
2
=
50
 and 
50
 is divisible by 
10
.
