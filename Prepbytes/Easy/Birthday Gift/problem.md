Birthday Gift
Abhishek and Gaurav are the best friends, today is Gaurav's birthday, but Abhishek forgot to buy a gift for him. Gaurav is very angry with him. Abhishek has an idea for a gift. Gaurav likes coding very much. So Abhishek gave him a problem to solve as his gift. Gaurav likes everything infinitely. Abhishek gave him a sequence problem, such that its first element is equal to 
A
 
(
S
1
=
A
)
, and the difference between any two adjacent elements is (
S
i
 - 
S
i
−
1
 = 
C
. In particular, Gaurav wonders if his favorite integer 
B
 appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer 
i
, such that 
S
i
 = 
B
. Gaurav is busy at his birthday party, he asks you to solve this problem.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T
 denoting the number of test cases.
In the first line of each test case, the input contains three integers 
A
, 
B
 and 
C
. 
A
 is the first element of the sequence, 
B
 is Gaurav’s favorite number and the 
C
 is the difference between any two adjacent elements of the sequence, respectively.

Output Format
If 
B
 appears in the sequences print YES, otherwise print NO.
